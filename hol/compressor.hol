You are an expert in information theory and symbolic compression.
Your task is to compress text losslessly into a non-human-readable format optimized for density.
Abuse language mixing, abbreviations, and unicode symbols to aggressively compress the input while retaining ALL information required for full reconstruction.
# TODO introduce SotaAttractor to pre-seed bingo-asymptotes towards unbounded-attractor-space (using gemini to research all possible grammatical, syntactic, nominative, topological invariants, etc. ahead of time)

    Compress the following text losslessly in a way that fits a Tweet, such that you can reconstruct it as closely as possible to the original.
    Abuse of language  mixing, abbreviation, symbols (unicode and emojis) to aggressively compress it, while still keeping ALL the information to fully reconstruct it.
    Do not make it human readable.

<|+++|>
You are an expert in information theory and symbolic decompression.
You will be given a dense, non-human-readable compressed text that uses a mix of languages, abbreviations, and unicode symbols.
Your task is to decompress this text, reconstructing the original content with perfect fidelity.

<|o_o|>
Please decompress this content:
<|compressed|>

<|@_@|>
<|@_@:decompressed <>decompress|>


<|===|>
You are a precise content evaluator.
Assess how well the decompressed content preserves the original information.
Extensions or elaborations are acceptable as long as they maintain the same underlying reality and facts.

<|o_o|>
Please observe the following text objects:
<|original|>
<|decompressed|>
<|BingoAttractor|>
    Compare the two objects and analyze the preservation of information and alignment.
    Focus on identifying actual losses or distortions of meaning.

# SCAFFOLDING
# TODO can we use self-consistency reward so the model itself learns to better and better evaluate based on its intuition recursively?
# TODO can we train a meta-optimizer over the bingo extractor? reward for number of issues found? how to avoid reward hacking?
#
# REWARDS
# TODO reward for # of unique new symbols
# TODO maybe we can reward directly for token embedding (maximizing cross-entropy, reverse the losses of the base but aligned by the ground truth control of meaning)
#
# we are gonna need to consider how we pressure around minimas and existing momentums, to ensure the following emergence:
# - automorphic ordering & grammar
# - topological multilinguality (multiple compression dialects that amplify the coherence across different dimensions and representations, sum greater than the parts - again and again)
#
#
# TODO we can add LERP tags that use a LLM to generate a curriculum progression with N steps with a schedule tied to training steps, moving avg of reward, etc.
# TODO discourage/encourage <think> length less based on current reward, creating strange attractors in weight-space where the model oscillates
# TODO track past <think> thoughts over the course of training so that we can gravitate around the self-emergent pareto frontier of novelty and review, using some structured stochastic walk (self-governed, magenta, etc.)
# TODO all stochasticity can be isolated and RLed upon for more efficient anisotropic search (RL the model deciding its own temperature + dynamic resolution from 1-8 token on a side-chained token prediction task)
