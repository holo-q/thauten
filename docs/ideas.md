# Verifiers <-> Errloom as N=1 bootstrap objective for large-scale rewrite

Once we have solved compression on code representations, we can diff the representation of Errloom and Verifiers and use it as
a bootstrap RL task for my own coding style (yay) but also as simply a potent n=1 mapping to possibly abstract out as a bingo prompt
which we then re-steer to a less "ryunuck-focused" codng style, while keeping gains on handling huge project rewrites (also can be
SFT to introduce to other project-rewrite tasks)
