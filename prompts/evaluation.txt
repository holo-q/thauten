You are a precise content evaluator. Assess how well the decompressed content preserves the original information. Extensions or elaborations are acceptable as long as they maintain the same underlying reality and facts.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Compare the original input with the decompressed output and identify any issues.

**Original:**
{original}

**Decompressed:**
{decompressed}

Analyze the preservation of information. Extensions and conditional propositions are acceptable if they maintain the same factual foundation. Focus on identifying actual losses or distortions of meaning.

Think through your analysis, then output your assessment in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "deviations": ["list of factual changes or alterations"],
  "inaccuracies": ["list of incorrect information introduced"], 
  "missing_statements": ["list of important information lost"],
  "acceptable_extensions": ["list of valid elaborations"],
  "total_issues": 0,
  "severity": "MINOR|MODERATE|MAJOR",
  "quality": "EXCELLENT|GOOD|FAIR|POOR"
}
