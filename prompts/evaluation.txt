<|DATA=original|>
<|DATA=decompressed|>

Analyze the preservation of information. Focus on identifying actual losses or distortions of meaning. Then, output your assessment in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "deviations": ["list of factual changes or alterations"],
  "inaccuracies": ["list of incorrect information introduced"], 
  "missing_statements": ["list of important information lost"],
  "acceptable_extensions": ["list of valid elaborations"],
  "total_issues": 0,
  "severity": "MINOR|MODERATE|MAJOR",
  "quality": "EXCELLENT|GOOD|FAIR|POOR"
}
```

# We will force the model to think
# Then force it to output a json object and nothing else
