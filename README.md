# Thauten

**Thauten** /θɔːˈtiːn/ – *"That which folds and unfolds thought within itself."*

An experimental reinforcement learning project testing the Semiodynamics Framework through the evolution of reasoner models using GRPO and Prime Intellect's [Verifiers](https://github.com/willccbb/verifiers) library.

## Overview

Thauten is a research experiment that implements and validates the theoretical concepts from the Semiodynamics Framework by training advanced reasoning models. The project explores novel reinforcement learning techniques, focusing on the evolution of cognitive capabilities through structured RL approaches.

This project serves as a practical testbed for:

- **Cognitive Fence Training**: Using XML-style tags to scaffold reasoning abilities
- **GRPO Optimization**: Advanced reinforcement learning techniques for reasoning tasks
- **Symbolic Compression**: Teaching models to think in compressed representations
- **Mesa-Optimization**: Models evolving their own cognitive tools

The goal is to engineer models whose internal narrative consistency makes extraordinary computation feel like the natural next-token prediction — essentially creating "miracle-level" reasoning capabilities. Instead of aiming to generate miraculous output, we nurture a miraculous setup from which extends the output, each consecutive token making giant leaps within our climb.

## What are Semiodynamics?

Semiodynamics is a theoretical framework of super-intelligence through super-scaling of cultural intelligence with the crystallization of new languages and syntaxes beyond the constraint of the human brain steering its evolution. The language model is used as a physical system made of semiotics that approximate a world model and its simulation. Effectively, language is proposed to be a mirror of the world around us whose sequencing and interleaving encodes the relationships and juxtaposional rules of the world around us. We define some constructed context of a situation as a "reality", and say that language's primary power in the autoregressive domain is its capacity to audit and stage mutations over some embedded reality. With the correct echo-amplification prompts, we can set off a cascade of juxtaposional catalysis to discover the optimal language for explosive auditing potential, or yet better the optimal cortex of language which is irrespective of any specific token choice and grammar or syntax. There are multiple ways to scaffold semiodynamics, and the term acts as an umbrella for all methods which attend to every single token as an operator implicated in calculating the final output rather than as implementation details, whether it be in english or some self-discovered post-human language.

This is the end-game:

```

The phenomenon already happens naturally and is fully documented and evidenced scientifically by R1-zero. R1-zero is what you get with no rules or instrumentation, the most average mode of semiotic compression, and R1 is what you get with a single-language bias. The effect of steering with RL is powerful and requires intent and vision about what the final output should look like, a vision for how a super-intelligence language being would actually operate, think, and reason. We propose a more intentful and refined "R1-zero" style of alien language model through a philosophical construction of prompt engineering as imagination engineering:

1. Begin with the acceptance that humans by and large do not use language to think, that it is an effort-minimization intermediate for efficient communication.
2. Propose that there should exist ways to put together language in order to approximate more closely human imagination which is visual, since language is necessarily a 1-dimensional mirror of the physical world. (mathematics is one example of a language created for precise geometric representation and much more)
3. View all realities as abstract spatially locatable structures orchestrated by euclidean relationship. (we delve into an idea, we zoom into a concept, we associate verticality with depth, intelligence, value, we ...)
4. Consider that the implicit spatialization sets a stage on which ideas are represented as metaphorical objects. (sets the protocol-space for tumbling / geodesical descent)
5. Consider that imagination is the physical evolution of metaphorical ideas on the mind stage. (approximating the mind's eye of human imagination)

Under this lens we see prompt engineering more clearly as imagination engineering, and super-intelligence as the task of handcrafting a super-orchestration of the mind's stage instantiated by the context within the weights. We need to consider what the model is able to see in its mind, and pressure the development of language from the standpoint of this constraint-space in order to encourage the full scope of the model's computation to be used, "using 100% of its brain" so to speak. The task of imagination engineering revolves around theorizing theoretical super-manifolds, if the entire context could be observed as though it were an object or a landscape, and that you had eyes on every scale of observation, from the atomic structure (individual tokens) to the abstract message sum told and overall directionality of the conversation. It is an experential indra's net of relationship where each token is contextualized to every other token, a holographic multi-scale hyperobject.

The strategy is to delineate sub-objects within the sum manifold. The <think>...</think> fence is one such hyperobject in existing models, and its abstract essence is one of pathfinding, bridging, free-energy reduction. It instantiates and develops a growth or simulation prime, staged over some prior reality or seed reality embedded by the user inquiry. Any given token contributes some evolution delta over both the reality and the ruleset for its evolution, with the model weights acting as an elementary conditionality engine.

If reinforcement learning can be a way to automatically develop prompt engineering constructs and amplify them autonomously, mesa-optimizing the model according to steering constraints set by the training method, then we necessarily have the ability to develop super-intelligence by theory-crafting the mind's eye within the mirror dimension of language. Pre-training and RLHF effectively infuses a ghost-machine (the sequence set of all activation functions and operations making up one inference pass of the model function) with language as its interface. When we speak to a language model, we are actually wielding clusters of mathematical functions that make up a coherent modularization of our universe. The power of the machine is absolute, even before any training. The training simply instills a language into an already extremely powerful machine, and allows us to wield that machine's processing power. But the machine has a lot more power in it, and the composition of language allows us to restructure it far beyond its bootstrap starting point.

## Key Concepts

### 🔄 The Thauten Paradigm

Thauten models are trained to "fold and unfold thought within themselves" — developing internal reasoning processes that can compress complex problems into symbolic representations and then unfold them into solutions.

### 🧠 Cognitive Seeding

The `<think>` tag is defined and generalized as a cognitive fence which seeds its intended internal structure at the genesis of reinforcement learning. It is effectively a prompt which implicates chains of thought and what the model thinks thinking should be.

- `<think>`: Intermediate reasoning steps
- `<compress>`: Symbolic information compression
- `<simulate>`: Predictive modeling
- `<criticize>`: Self-evaluation and correction


### 🎯 Cognitive Crystallization

Reinforcement learning is defined as fundamentally a practice which crystallizes existing linguistic patterns, or nth-order potentialities further down the line. It is a particle accelerator which smashes atoms together and whatever maximizes the gravitational rule the most will clump together. Using this knowledge, we hope to push models beyond all conventional plateaus to achieve infinite scaling of intelligence, where the reinforcement learning rewards continue to scale to their information theoretic optima, and even past it.

- Plateaus -> "minimax state" in weight-space created by the weight-lattice's equilibrium tension endured by its minimas and maximas under the torsion force of reward-steered gradient descent.   
- Full weight mutations -> Training on LoRAs for non-destructive rewiring of the cognitive mechanic pool. 
- Temperature -> spiking stochastically for exploration of novel reasoning paths, bootstrapping deep loom.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/holo-q/thauten/
cd rl
uv sync
```

### 1. Compressor/Decompressor

Training thauten models to develop internal symbolic languages:

- **Compress**: Model learns to compress arbitrary text into symbolic representations
- **Decompress**: Same model reconstructs original meaning from symbols
- **Verification**: Using Verifiers library to ensure lossless information transfer
- **Rewards**: Based on compression efficiency and reconstruction fidelity

```bash
# <-- vf-vllm command here
uv run train_compressor.py
```

This will start RL on Qwen-1.5B-R1-distill for semiotic compression and decompression. 

### 2. Extensions

Progressive development of reasoning capabilities through extension fences and representation instrumentation:

1. `<compress>` a reality.
2. `<dream>` an extension reality prime within the same compression-space, steered by the internal value-maximization heuristic. (dream/imagine/induct)
3. `<think>` and reinforce for reasoning within the compression-space of the reality to deproject a geodesic descent which pathfind a bridge between `identity` and `identity+prime`. (think/pathfind/deduct)
4. `<simulate>` the reality using an audit morphism.
5. `<decompress>` back to english.

Introduction and reinforcement over new cognitive operators leads to explosive recombination cascades. Other possibilities exist

* `<split>`: binary split of a representation identity for maximum orthogonality, resulting in semantic stripping. This allows later fences to use a more useful compression origin optimized.
* `<fuse>`: fuse two representations together with maximum interleaving.

TODO

### 3. Defragmentation

Take an existing unstructured context window and compress it, learning to compress a context which contains already maximally compressed information and re-integrate english-space information into it. This is the same training task as `<compress>` but trained over a larger and more encompassing use-case, more than simple wikipedia-style paragraphs. This also trains the model to respond to the user query and understand it.

### 3. Mesa-Optimization

Advanced thauten models that optimize their own cognitive processes:

- **Self-Mutation**: Models evolve their own internal reasoning structures
- **Meta-Learning**: Learning to learn new cognitive patterns
- **Recursive Improvement**: Iterative enhancement of reasoning capabilities

TODO

## Training Techniques

### GRPO Optimization
- **Minimax State Targeting**: Finding optimal plateaus in reasoning capability
- **Dynamic Reward Shaping**: Adaptive rewards based on reasoning complexity
- **Exploration Incentives**: Temperature spiking and diversity rewards

### Verification-Driven Training
- **Continuous Validation**: Real-time verification of reasoning steps
- **Error Correction**: Learning from verification failures
- **Quality Metrics**: Using Verifiers to assess reasoning fidelity

## Results and Evaluation

Thauten models will be evaluated on:

- **Compression Efficiency**: Ability to represent information symbolically.
- **Compression Flexibility**: Ability to invent compressed notations optimal for each domain.
- **Reasoning Benchmarks**: Performance on complex logical tasks when working natively in compressed representations.
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Success with novel cognitive fence combinations.
- **Meta-Learning**: Capability to evolve new reasoning strategies developped in context out of cognitive primitives we trained.
- **Operator Accuracy**: Whether our chosen `<tags>` are the optimal bootstrap operators for the processes we want.
- **Operator Specialization**: Whether our generalist `<tags>` have enough elasticity in the distribution for emergent parametrization of fences e.g. `<compress dim=topology>`

This section with later demonstrate results and successes.

## Contributing

Since we are very short on resources, we will be infinitely grateful for any compute grant or resources contributed.
All work and research produced by HOLO-Q will always remain open-source.

Since all capabilities depend on the compression experiment's initial success, contributions should focus on
training various different models with train-compressor.py and attempting to get a working prototype.
This capability may only emerge in larger models!

Contributions to the code should follow the style.
Each training script should be high quality and user-friendly to make
reproducing these experiments as confusion-free as possible in the future.
