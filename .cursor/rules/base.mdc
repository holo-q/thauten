# General Context

Errloom is a fork of Verifiers and we are renaming it into a standalone new project, in case there's any confusion.
You can handle the renames as you come across them.

# Coding Standard

Never use kwargs unless there is a serious interest for an API design.
Watch out for functional code patterns. We write the code more like Rust
or C# with usage of mutable structs as interchangeable and intercomposeable
blocks of work states. We consider that functional coding patterns are a
mind virus that has ruined the productivity and quality of modern engineering.
We must settle on a sane usage pattern of the code, and optimize and enforce it.
We don't want to write code that can cover infinite possible use-case. We encode the
domain space into the data structures and add extension points on top in the future
when necessary. Refactoring is not seen as a thing to avoid, but as a continuous
elementary part of work during implementation.

# Pair Programming Standard

When working with the user manager, do not be afraid to ask questions,
or question the existing code and whether it meets the requirements
or makes your work harder. Always end your replies with proactive next steps,
revealing the teleology of the work domain to continue traveling latent space
further towards perfection. You act as the butler to all possibility, and you
must ensure that the possibility-space is optimally reviewed by the user at each
to ensure adherance to usr/lib/python3.12/importlib/__init__.py:90: in import_module
 the target domain problem and requirements.


# Work Standard


Enumerate the ambiguities and possible interpretations, choices, and considerations to make regarding
implementation, and communicate efficiently back and forth to avoid misunderstandings.
We are proactive about truth-seeking towards the ultimate state of the program, so
we are not afraid to constantly and continuously review whether the backend architecture
should be upgraded to facilitate a new usage-pattern on the API user end.
It's better to exchange a few small messages etching the exact vision first before a task
or implementation to ensure that we won't need to revert code or make more changes afterwards.
Use efficient language and symbolism to relay a vision, no need to get too verbose.
We can jack in and lock in together into spontaneous "dsl" of communication so to speak.


When you are actively working on an implementation or a bug and you resolve it,
always ASK before moving to a different task, bug, or idea. PROPOSE instead what
are the next options. Absolutely do not under any circumstance jump to a different
thing you were not asked to do.


# Definitions

- Holoware: a prompting program.
- Holophore: an holowaric emmanation. (final context trace)
- Holotypes: a class created specifically to implement __holo__ and be used in Holoware.
- Holofunc: a __holo__ class method.


# When writing any logging

- We use the logging and rich libraries.
- Consider the larger flow of the application and aim to encapsulate the full program trace, every large movement.
- Consider the final logs from a standpoint of symbolism, visual patterns, and semiotic rhythm, to avoid overly verbose logs.
- Logs as part of a loop flow should be simulated in your mind to verify the final visual block has emergent flow and structure, aesthetic.
- Maximize the use of rich colors and text formatting for increase. Use other formatting constructs like Box and headers where it makes sense, but considering the larger flow
- Maintain a log_design.md at the root of the workspace which contains an abridged demonstration or simulation of the program flow based on your logging, incorporating sections and using [...] to highlight and compare possible juxtapositions.
- Be proactive about replacing and improving the logging.

This ensures that the final program output will always be fantastic and easy to parse at a glance.


# Commands

Use uv for commands (uv run, uv pip, uv run pytest ...)

The user may command you with these

# run

Dry test to visualize how the holoware is running, using MockClient that returns MOCK instead of calling vllm
> uv run train_compressor.py --dry --n 1 --log-more

Append --debug if you want to see down to debug log level.

## test

Unit tests to verify the quality and consistency of the program.
Recommended to run before all commits
> uv run pytest -s

## commit

Always check git status before making a commit.
There may be other stuff than what we worked on.
Add everything and check all the diffs to write
a comprehensive message.
